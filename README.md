# Book Inventory Example App README

This app is an example used in [this](https://buildbench.net/articles/react-js-hooks-clean-approach-to-state-management)
article, covering the concept of using hooks to cleanly manage React app state and component lifecycle.

This is a very simple example for using useState and creating custom hooks.
